        <h1>Museums</h1>
        <p>DC is home to an enormous variety of terrific museums, covering countless subjects. This section covers a few of my personal favorites, but there are far more to discover while you're there!</p>
        <h2>The Smithsonian Museums</h2>

        </p>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">The Smithsonian Institutes run <i>sixteen</i> different museums, galleries, and a zoo in the DC area. These museums are among the finest in the world, and all have no entrance fee! There are eleven of them around the National Mall, making that a perfect destination for museum lovers!</p>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">My personal favorites are the Air and Space Museum, the Archives of American Art, and the Natural History Museum.</p>

		<h2>The Newseum</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The Newseum is a unique museum dedicated to the history of journalism and free press in the United States. There's no place better to get a sense of the power of the press and personal freedoms and the sacrifice those freedoms often require.</p>
        <h2>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/HolocauseMemorialMuseum.jpeg" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 6.5in; }" />
        </p>
        <p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is an incredible, moving museum dedicated to ensuring nobody forget the horrible events of the Holocaust. Immersive and powerful, this museum does not shy away from the facts and the history of what lead up to, and happened during the Holocaust. </p>
        <h3>The International Spy Museum</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/SpyMuseum.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>The International Spy Museum is a fascinating museum about spies and spying throughout history. With a ton of information, artifacts, and hands-on activities, this is one of the best museums for family fun.</p>

                <p>Buredo is an innovative sushi spot near 14th street with an eye for fresh, fantastic food. They specialize in burrito-sized sushi rolls, tasty bowls, and super-fresh salads. There are a ton of options for the seasoned sushi fan and for soon-to-be fans. Be sure to check out their super-cool Blade Runner mural while you're there! </p>
                <p>My recommendation:&#160;Try the Nikkia Bowl for something just a little bit spicy!</p>

                <p>Sticky Rice is a hip Asian-fusion restaurant with a laid-back atmosphere and plenty of tasty meals. They specialize in rice and noodle dishes with a variety of toppings, and have plenty of tasty options for vegans and vegetarians too! One of their more off-the-wall options is their series of bucketfuls of tater tots (or sweet tater tots!).</p>
                <p>My recommendation:&#160;The Millenium</p>

                <p>If you're still hungry, be on the lookout for a food truck! You're sure to find one at one of San Diego's many outdoor festivals or events, or even parked at a local brewery or mall. Food trucks offer dining on-the-go and serve up tasty gourmet meals. There is a food truck for every appetite: bratwursts, salads, crabcakes, hot dogs, crepes, pierogi, and more.</p>

        <h1>The DC Metro</h1>
        <p>Washington DC's Metro, formally known as the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), began construction in 1969, and has operated consistently ever since. Development of its most recent addition, the Silver Line, began in 1994, and gives the Metro increased reach over the western side of DC.</p>
        <p>For visitors or newcomers looking to find their way around DC using Metro, it can seem a little daunting with its six inter-woven lines and numerous stops. However, with some help, the Metro will quickly become second nature, and an inexpensive and useful way to get around the city. </p>

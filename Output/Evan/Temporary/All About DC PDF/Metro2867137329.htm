        <p>Washington DC's Metro, formally known as the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), began construction in 1969, and has operated consistently ever since. Development of its most recent addition, the Silver Line, began in 1994, and gives the Metro increased reach over the western side of DC.</p>
        <p>For visitors or newcomers looking to find their way around DC using Metro, it can seem a little daunting with its six inter-woven lines and numerous stops. However, with some help, the Metro will quickly become second nature, and an inexpensive and useful way to get around the city. </p>

        <h3>Planning your Metro Route</h3>
        <p>The Metro map is located throughout Metro stations and on all trains. If you know the general area or neighborhood you need to go to, you can use it to navigate your way through DC. If you are new to the area or need more help, there are trip planners on the <a href="https://www.wmata.com/">WMATA Website</a>. If you choose the "travel by train" option in the Google Maps phone app, it will interface with the WMATA system and tell you exactly what trains you need to ride and when. It even covers transfers!</p>

        <h3>Purchasing your SmarTrip® Card</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In order to ride on the Metro, you need what's known as a "SmarTrip®" Card. These are cards that you can load with money and tap at the turn-stiles at Metro entrances and exits to automatically pay the correct amount for your trip. You muse purchase one before you ride, though!</p>
        <p>If planning ahead, you may purchase one on the <a href="https://smartrip.wmata.com/storefront">WMATA Store</a>, or may wait and purchase one at the station.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="file:///C:/Coding/school/all-about-DC/Output/Evan/Temporary/All About DC PDF/All About DC PDF_2FFF8316/Resources/Images/SmartripKiosk.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>Here's how to purchase a SmarTrip® card from one of the station kiosks like these.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">If you don't own a SmarTrip® card, use the numbered buttons on the side to select the option for ordering a new one.</li>
            <li value="2">You will then be asked to specify how much money you'd like to load onto the card. Enter that amount using the add/deduct values buttons in the center.</li>
            <li value="3">Choose your payment type, and enter your payment using the bill or card payment section. These kiosks accept most major credit / debit cards.</li>
            <li value="4">When payment is complete, your new SmarTrip® Card will be ready to ride!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Riding</h3>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">When entering the platform area, make sure you are at the platform that is for the line color you chose <i>and</i> in the direction you need to go. In some stations the platforms for the different directions are on opposite sides of the track.</p>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">While on the train, be courteous to fellow riders and follow all posted rules. This includes not playing music without headphones, not bringing any open drinks, and staying away from the doors while on the train.</p>
        <h3>Re-loading your SmarTrip® Card </h3>
        <p>If you spend enough time in DC, you will likely need to add additional money to you SmarTrip® card. This can be done at the same kiosks as before. In order to re-load your card, select the option on the screen and tap your card to the sensor. You may then select your amount and pay with either cash or credit / debit card. Then, tap your card one last time to complete the transaction.</p>
